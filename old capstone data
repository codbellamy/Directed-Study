I have some data that Matt/Will may be able to use for the 2nd half.  Some possibilities:

(year) is Capstone year
1. (2019) enlisted competencies 600K rows by 9 columns
2. (2016) selective reenlistment bonus - monthly reenlistment numbers data for several years for hundreds of rates

I may have more...
